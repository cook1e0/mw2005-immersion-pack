### v0.13.0: direct wheel steering, turning steering wheel, new force feedback

- **Wheel steering:** a bound wheel used to reach the game as a gamepad: a few degrees of front
  wheel lock at speed (40 parked, ~3 at top speed) and a slow steering ramp, so half the wheel's
  rotation barely steered. The game's own real-wheel mode is now used: the front wheels follow
  the wheel directly, full lock (45 degrees) at `[Controls] SteeringLock`, at any speed. F4 >
  Controls > Speed-sensitive steering restores a lock that shrinks with speed.
- **Turning steering wheel:** the player car's steering wheel turns with yours, by the same angle,
  in every car with a modelled wheel (found automatically in the interior model; 36 of 38 cars).
  `[VR] SteeringWheel=0` turns it off. Works in VR and on a flat screen.
- **Force feedback:** new speed-sensitive centring (`-K * v * sin(angle)`), understeer lightening,
  surface rumble on grass/dirt/gravel from the game's surface data, kerb kicks from the body's
  vertical jerk (hills don't trigger them), directional impacts (head-on shake, side kick), wall
  scrapes, a limp wheel in the air and a landing jolt. All in F4 > Force feedback.
- **Force direction fix:** with `ForceSign=0` (direction test never passed) every constant force
  was silently zero, leaving only springs and vibration. The test now measures against the
  wheel's drift and switches to sending the direction separately (`ForceDirection=1`) for drivers
  that ignore negative forces. `ffbtool test [n]` checks a wheel by hand; F4 has "Reverse force
  direction".

**Upgrading from v0.12.1:** replace all three plugins and `ffbtool.exe`. Keep your `.ini` files.

### v0.12.1: cockpit crash and garbage polygons fixed, settings kept

- **VR cockpit crash:** the VR mod's driver-model cache was never refreshed. After the game
  streamed a car model out and loaded another at the same address (traffic, car resets, race
  restarts), the cockpit kept drawing with the freed model's vertex buffer: big dark garbage
  polygons in the cockpit, then a crash inside `d3d9.dll` when the game released its model
  buffers (seen right after opening F4). Changed or reloaded models are now prepared again, and
  the head-less copy of a draw entry always uses the live vertex buffer.
- **Near plane default:** `[VR] NearZ` now defaults to 0.05 m (the game's own is 0.5 m); 0.01 m
  cost too much depth precision. Existing ini values are kept.

**Upgrading from v0.12.0:** replace `scripts
fsmw_vr.asi` and `scripts
fsmw_gameplay.asi`.

### v0.12.0: cockpit near plane, VR recenter binding, misshift damage

- **VR near clip plane:** the player view's near plane is now `[VR] NearZ` (default 0.01 m, was
  the game's own 0.5 m), so the dashboard, wheel and pillars right in front of the eyes are no longer
  cut off. Adjustable live in F4 > VR > Near clip plane. 0 in the ini restores the game's value.
  Very low values can make distant surfaces flicker (depth precision).
- **Recenter VR view binding:** F4 > Controls > Recenter VR view binds any key, wheel or button
  to the VR mod's recentre (same as F8). Works while driving and in the game's menus.
- **Misshift damage:** a shift refused for lack of clutch has a 50% chance of doing 5% car damage
  (`[Shifter] MisshiftChance`, `MisshiftDamage`, also in F4 > Shifter and clutch). Needs car damage
  on; `MisshiftChance=0` turns it off.

**Upgrading from v0.11.2:** replace `scripts
fsmw_vr.asi` and `scripts
fsmw_gameplay.asi`. Keep
your existing `.ini` files and bindings; the new settings use their defaults when missing, so the
lower near plane and misshift damage are on after the update. The force feedback plugin,
`nfsmw_vr_host.exe` and `nfsmw_crashdump.exe` are unchanged. The near-plane slider needs both
updated plugins.

### v0.11.2: recovery and regression fixes

- **Force feedback recovery:** reacquires previously working wheels after Alt-Tab or focus
  changes, restores stopped or unloaded effects, and retries failed effect operations.
  F4 menu transitions also trigger a recovery check. Forces return gradually after recovery.
- **Manual restart:** press F10 or choose F4 > Force Feedback > Restart wheel force feedback.
  Calibration and tuning are preserved. This resets the mod's effects, not native game FFB;
  `[FFB] KeyReset` changes the hotkey (`0` disables it).
- **Controller input:** neutralises held startup inputs and sends buffered release events
  when the game's controller input is disabled; deferred menu-reset events are preserved.
- **Gameplay:** fixes axis-binding direction and stale player-smoke selection. Legacy
  H-shifter settings can replace untouched packaged defaults, while customised gameplay
  INIs remain unchanged and the legacy file is retained for manual merging.
- **VR:** validates required hooks while preserving compatible widescreen resolution
  detours, and tightens OpenXR tracking/frame handling.
- **Crash diagnostics (VR):** the VR plugin starts `nfsmw_crashdump.exe`, a small helper next
  to `speed.exe`. An unhandled game crash saves `nfsmw_crash.dmp` and a readable
  `nfsmw_crash.txt` (faulting module, offset, exception code, access address). Nothing is
  uploaded. On by default, also with existing ini files; `[VR] CrashDumps=0` disables it. A
  missing helper is logged and the game still runs.

Force feedback now pauses while the game is not the foreground window and comes back when it is.

**Upgrading from v0.11.1:** replace all three plugins in `scripts` and `nfsmw_vr_host.exe`, and
add `nfsmw_crashdump.exe` next to `speed.exe`. Keep your existing `.ini` files and bindings.

**Validation:** all three plugins build, and the input, FFB recovery, gameplay, cockpit, hook,
OpenXR and crash-capture regression tests pass. Not yet tested with a physical wheel or headset;
the crash capture helps diagnose the reported Direct3D crash but does not fix it.

### v0.11.1: pedals in menus

- **Pedals in menus**: analog controller axes are ignored in the game's menus by default, preventing pedals and steering from scrolling them. With the game's controller input enabled, buttons and the d-pad still work. Driving input is unchanged.
- **Menu input settings**: F4 > Controls can restore analog axis navigation or disable all controller menu input. The F4 menu's own bindings and keyboard/mouse input are unaffected.
- **Pause and resume**: menu input uses neutral axis values from the controller's configured ranges, including buffered input and pedals held still when entering or leaving a menu.

**Upgrading from v0.11.0:** replace `scripts\nfsmw_ffb.asi` and `scripts\nfsmw_gameplay.asi`. Keep your existing `.ini` files and bindings; the menu filter uses its defaults when the new settings are missing. It requires the updated force feedback plugin, including when using `NativeFFB=1`. The VR plugin and helper are unchanged.

**Validation:** both updated plugins build successfully and the menu input regression tests pass. Physical wheel/pedal testing remains outstanding.
